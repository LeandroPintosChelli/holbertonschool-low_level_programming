## C - Doubly Linked Lists
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language: manipulating doubly linked lists by printing/inserting/deleting nodes,
> freeing nodes, and using the node data (e.g. to get a total sum)

### Description of what each file shows:
* lists.h .... header file with structure defined and function prototypes
* Files that start with:
