# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Requirements
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* pointers and how to use them
* arrays and how to use them
* differences between pointers and arrays
* how to use strings and how to manipulate them
* scope of variables

## Description of what each file does:
0.0-reset_to_98.c: a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value of the int to 98

1-swap.c: a function that swaps the values of two integers

2-strlen.c: a function that returns the length of a string

3-puts.c: a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout

4-print_rev.c: a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line

5-rev_string.c: a function that reverses a string

6-puts2.c: a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line

7-puts_half.c: a function that prints half of a string, and (length_of_string - 1) / 2 if odd length

8-print_array.c: a function that prints n elements of an array of integers

9-strcpy.c: a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest

##More pointers and arrays:

0-strcat.c: function that concatenates two strings

1-strncat.c: function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string

2-strncpy.c: function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes

3-strcmp.c: function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values

4-rev_array.c: function that reverses the content of an array of integers

5-string_toupper.c: function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

7-leet.c: function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)

##Even more pointer and arrays:

0-memset.c: a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)

1-memcpy.c: a function that copies memory area (memcpy)

2-strchr.c: a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)

3-strspn.c: a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)

4-strpbrk.c: a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)

5-strstr.c: a function that locates a substring (strstr)

7-print_chessboard.c: a function that prints the chessboard

8-print_diagsums.c: a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
