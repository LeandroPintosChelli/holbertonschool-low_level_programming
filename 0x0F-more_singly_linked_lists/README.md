## C - More singly linked lists
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> how to manipulate linked lists via printing all elements, printing nth node, inserting and deleting nodes at the beginning/ending/nth element, and freeing nodes.

### Description of what each file shows:
lists.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes
* Files that start with:
0. a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

2. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

4. a function that frees a listint_t list.

5. a function that frees a listint_t list.

6. a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).

7. a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

8. a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

9. a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

10. a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
