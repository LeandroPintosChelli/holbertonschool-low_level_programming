## Synopsis
This repositoy holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* what a static library is.
* how it works.
* how to create one `ar -cr`.
* how to use it.

## Description of what each file shows:
1. libmy.a - created this static library containing some functions.
2. main.h - included function prototypes of functions in library.
3. create_static_lib.sh - shell script to compile pre linking and create static library.
